      "Bubble Sort\n",
      "================\n",
      "\n",
      "Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly iterating through a list of elements, comparing adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Bubble Sort Works\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how bubble sort works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Initialization**: The algorithm starts by iterating through the list from the first element to the last.\n",
      "2.  **Comparison and Swap**: In each iteration, it compares the current element with the next one. If they are in the wrong order (i.e., the current element is greater than the next one), it swaps them.\n",
      "3.  **Repeat**: The algorithm repeats this process until it reaches the end of the list.\n",
      "4.  **No More Swaps**: After completing each pass through the list, if no swaps were made during that iteration, the list is sorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example Use Case\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose we have a list of integers: `[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]`. We want to sort this list in ascending order using bubble sort. Here's how it would work:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Initial Pass**:\n",
      "    *   Compare `64` and `34`, swap because `34` is smaller.\n",
      "    *   Compare `34` and `25`, swap because `25` is smaller.\n",
      "    *   ... (and so on)\n",
      "2.  **First Swap**: The list becomes `[25, 34, 12, 22, 11, 64, 90]`.\n",
      "3.  **Second Pass**:\n",
      "    *   Compare `25` and `12`, swap because `12` is smaller.\n",
      "    *   ... (and so on)\n",
      "4.  **Final Swap**: The list becomes `[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Code Implementation\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a Python implementation of bubble sort:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def bubble_sort(lst):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    Sorts a list using the bubble sort algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Args:\n",
      "        lst (list): The input list to be sorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Returns:\n",
      "        list: The sorted list.\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    # Get the length of the list\n",
      "    n = len(lst)\n",
      "\n",
      "    for i in range(n-1):\n",
      "        # Initialize a flag to track if any swaps were made\n",
      "        swapped = False\n",
      "\n",
      "        # Iterate through each element in the list\n",
      "        for j in range(n-i-1):\n",
      "            # Compare adjacent elements and swap if they're in the wrong order\n",
      "            if lst[j] > lst[j+1]:\n",
      "                lst[j], lst[j+1] = lst[j+1], lst[j]\n",
      "                swapped = True\n",
      "\n",
      "        # If no swaps were made during this pass, the list is sorted\n",
      "        if not swapped:\n",
      "            break\n",
      "\n",
      "    return lst\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example usage:\n",
      "lst = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n",
      "print(\"Original List:\", lst)\n",
      "sorted_lst = bubble_sort(lst)\n",
      "print(\"Sorted List:\", sorted_lst)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Complexity\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the list. However, it can be improved to O(n) by adding a flag to check if any swaps were made during each pass, and breaking out early if no swaps are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Space Complexity\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The space complexity of bubble sort is O(1), as it only requires a single additional memory space for the temporary swap variable.\n"

      "**Bugs:**\n",

      "* The function does not handle the case where the input list `numbers` is empty. It will raise an exception when trying to access the first element.\n",

      "**Performance issues:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The function has a time complexity of O(n), which is acceptable for small lists, but can be slow for large lists. It's also possible that the range() function might not work as expected if the size of numbers is very large.\n",
      "* A more efficient solution would use the built-in `max()` function or a single pass through the list to find the maximum value.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Code style and readability:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The variable name `max` is misleading. It's better to use a more descriptive name, such as `max_value`.\n",
      "* The code could benefit from additional comments to explain what each section does.\n",
      "* The docstring for the function would be helpful in understanding its purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestions for improvement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use type hints to indicate that the input list contains numbers.\n",
      "* Add error handling to deal with non-numeric values and empty lists.\n",
      "* Consider adding a docstring to describe the function's behavior, parameters, and return value.\n",
